# Vatic #

Vatic is a Python package for applying Pyomo and Egret to simulating the
optimized behaviour of power grids under a given set of scenarios. It is
meant as a lightweight replacement for Prescient, which is available
[here](https://github.com/grid-parity-exchange/Prescient).


## Installing Vatic ##

After making sure you have Python 3.8 installed, clone the repository:

```git clone git@github.com:PrincetonUniversity/Vatic.git```

Then, from inside the cloned directory, install Vatic:
```
cd Vatic
pip install .
```


## Running Vatic ##

Installing vatic adds the command `vatic-det` to your command line
namespace, which is called the following way:

```vatic-det $input_dir $output_dir $start_date $end_date ```

`input_dir` is the directory storing the dataset to be used for the run.
This directory should be structured in the same way as *e.g.* directories
downloaded using the Prescient downloaders. Thus you can use directories
generated by these downloaders, such as ```Prescient/downloads/texas-7k```,
as `input_dir`.

`output_dir` is where the output will be stored, which will consist of a copy
of `input_dir` and any generated scenarios.

`start_date` and `end_date` are the starting and ending dates of the simulation,
given in YYYY-MM-DD format, *e.g.* 2018-07-10 and 2018-07-11.

In addition to these required arguments, `vatic-det` accepts the following
optional arguments:

`--threads` The number of compute cores to be used for parallelization.
If you are running `vatic-det` on a remote compute cluster, do not use
more cores than what has been allocated to you for a particular job.
The default value is 1, which will not parallelize any computation. Must be
a non-negative integer; a value of 0 will instruct the solvers to use all
possible nodes, which is not recommended when running on remote clusters.

`--sced_horizon` How far ahead in hours each security-constrained economic
dispatch instance will look ahead. Must be a positive integer; the default
value is 4.

`--ruc_mipgap` The relative optimality gap used by each reliability unit
commitment instance to decide when to terminate. Expressed as a ratio
of the difference between the lower and upper objective bound and the
incumbent objective value. The default value is 0.01.

`--solver` The solver to use for RUC and SCED instances, such as `cbc` or
`gurobi`. The default is `cbc`; note that you may have to install your
preferred solver separately.
